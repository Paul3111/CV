## Paul Lazar

I am an organized and dependable individual who thrives on managing multiple priorities with a positive attitude. What excites me the most about coding is the endless potential it offers to create innovative solutions and shape the future. As someone who made a career change into the tech industry, I am driven by the desire to be part of a dynamic field that is constantly evolving and pushing boundaries. I am always eager to take on additional responsibilities to contribute to my team's goals and make a meaningful impact.
